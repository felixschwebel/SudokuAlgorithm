# SudokuAlgorithm
An algorithm for solving Sudokus which uses the Tkinter module to create a graphical user interface. The idea for this project came in an Information-Management-lecture where we solved Sudokus by hand in preparation for the lecture on sorting algorithms. 

It just works for easy and medium Sudokus when there is no guessing involved at the moment.
